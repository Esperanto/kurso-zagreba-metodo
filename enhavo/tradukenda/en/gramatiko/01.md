# Alphabet

The Esperanto alphabet consists of 28 letters: a, b, c, ĉ, d, e, f, g, ĝ, h, ĥ, i, j, ĵ, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, ŝ, t, u, ŭ, v, z.

Note the following differences from English:

- __a__ as in "father"
- __c__ = ts as in "Betsy"
- __ĉ__ = ch as in "church"
- __e__ as in "there"
- __g__ as in "give"
- __ĝ__ as in "judge"
- __h__ as in "hammer"
- __ĥ__ = Scottish ch as in "Loch"
- __i__ as in "machine"
- __j__ = y as in "yes". __aj__, __ej__, __oj__, __uj__ are diphtongs consisting respectivel of a, e, o, u plus a short i-sound. Thus
	- __aj__ = i in "die"
	- __ej__ = a in "face"
	- __oj__ = oy in "boy"
	- __uj__ = ui in "ruin", prnounced quickly.
- __ĵ__ = zh  as in "measure"
- __o__  as in "north"
- __r__ is always pronounced – ideally, rolled
- __s__ as in "sense"
- __ŝ__ = sh in "sharp"
- __u__ as in "fool"
- __ŭ__ = w as in "tower". __aŭ__, __eŭ__ are diphtongs consisting respectively of "a" or "e" plus a short oo-sound. Thus
	- aŭ = ou in "mouth"
	- eŭ is as "eh-oo".


# Pronunciation

Words are pronounced exactly as spelled, applying the equivalents mentioned above, e.g.

- *amiko* = ah-MEE-koh
- *ĉambro* = CHAHM-broh
- *ĝi* = jee.

# Stress

Words of more than one syllable are stressed on the last syllable but one, e.g.

- *te-le-FO-no* (teh-leh-FOH-noh)
- *ra-DI-o* (rah-DEE-oh)
- *kaj* (kigh)
- a-MI-ko (ah-MEE-koh)
- ES-tas (ESS-tahss).
- NB: AN-kaŭ (because kaŭ is a single syllable).

Be careful over words like historio (hi-sto-RI-o, hee-stoh-REE-oh).

# Article

The definite article is *la* (– *the). It is invariable (no change for gender, case or number). There is no indefinite article:

- *la amiko* – the friend
  - *amiko* – a friend
- *la laboro* – the work
  - *laboro* – work

# Personal Pronouns

- *mi* – I
- *vi* – you
- *li* – he
- *ŝi* – she
- *ĝi* – it
- *ni* – we
- *ili* – they

The pronouns *li, ŝi, ĝi* are used in just the same way as English "he, she, it".

# Possessive Pronouns

These are formed by adding the ending __a__ to the simple pronouns:

- *mia* – my
- *via* – your
- *lia* – his
- *ŝia* – her
- *ĝia* – its
- *nia* – our
- *ilia* – their

# Nouns

All nouns end in -O. There is no grammatical gender: where appropriate, feminine sex is indicated by a suffix.

- *tabl__o__* – table
- *lernant__o__* – learner
- *lernant__in__o* – learner (female)

# Plural

The plural ending is __j__. Both nouns and adjectives take this ending, e.g.:

- *tablo__j__* – tables
- *lernanto__j__* – learners
- *via__j__ lernanto__j__* – your learners

# Verbs

1. The infinitive ending is __-i__, e.g.
   - *lern__i__* – to learn
   - *labor__i__* – to work
   - *est__i__* – to be.
2. The present tense ending is __-as__. It is the same for all persons and numbers:
   - *mi sid__as__* – I sit
   - *vi sid__as__* – you sit
   - *ni sid__as__* – we sit
   - *ili sid__as__* – they sit.

# *Ĉu?*

This is an interrogative particle, used to turn a statement into a yes/no question:

- *__Ĉu__ vi sidas?* – Are you sitting?
- *__Ĉu__ vi skribas?* – Are you writing? Do you write?

# *Kiu?*

This interrogative functions both as a pronoun ("who?") and as an adjective ("which?"), e.g.

- *__Kiu__ vi estas?* – Who are you?
- *__Kiu__ instruisto sidas?* – Which teacher is sitting?


# The Suffix *-ist*

is used to form th ename of a person regularly engaged in some activity, e.g.


- *instru__ist__o* – teacher
- *hotel__ist__o* – hotelier, hotel-keeper
- *esperant__ist__o* – Esperantist, adherent of Esperanto


# The Suffix *-in*

is used to form the feminine of a noun:

- *patro* – father
    - *patr__in__o* – mother
- *lernanto* – pupil
    - *lernant__in__o* – pupil (female)
- *instruisto* – teacher
    - *instruist__in__o* – (woman) teacher

# Affirmative Particle

*__jes__* has the same sound and meaning as the English "yes".

- *Ĉu vi estas en la ĉambro?* 
  - *__Jes__, mi estas en la ĉambro.* 

# Negative Particle

*__ne__* corresponds to "no" (opposite of "yes") and to "not":

- *__Ne__, mi __ne__ estas en la ĉambro.*
