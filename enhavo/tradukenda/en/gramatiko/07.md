# Negation

The rules for negation are much as in English.


- *__Nek__ li __nek__ ŝi respondis.*   – Neither he or she answered.
- *Vi __nek__ sidas __nek__ rigardas.* – You are neither sitting nor looking.

- *Mi __neniam__ diros al iu.* – I shall never tell anyone. (*Mi neniam diros al neniu* is wrong in Esperanto just as "I shan't never tell no-one" is in English.)


# *Mem*

*Mem* means "self" (myself, yourself, himself etc.) and is used to emphasize the noun or pronoun it follows. (Compare *si*, reflexive, lesson 4.)

- *Mi __mem__ faris tion.*  – I myself did that, I did that myself.

# Bye…

There are various ways of saying "goodbye" in Esperanto, but the most usual is *ĝis la revido*, literally  "until the re-seeing" (compare English "see you", French "au revoir". Alternatively it may be said without the article, *ĝis revido*.
