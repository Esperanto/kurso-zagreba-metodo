# *-u* in Noun Clauses

The imperative ending *-u* is used not only (as we have already seen) in direct commands and so on, but also in indirect speech in clauses introduced by *ke* after verbs of commanding, requesting, advising, whishing. (These often correspond to English clauses with "to".)

- *Mi deziras, __ke__ vi lern__u__.* – I want that you learn.
- *La patro insistas, __ke__ mi iru.* – Father insists that I go. 
 
# The Preposition *je*

The preposition *je* is kind of a joker. It has no precise meaning, but is used where no other preposition covers the exact meaning one wishes to express. Amongst other things, it is the usual word for translating "at" when telling the time.

- *__Je__ kioma horo vi venos?* – What time will you come? (lit.: At the how-manyeth hour?)
- *__Je__ la kvina horo.* – At five o'clock.
