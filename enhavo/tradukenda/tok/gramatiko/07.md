# Negation

The rules for negation are much as in English.


- *__Nek__ li __nek__ ŝi respondis.*   – Neither he or she answered.
- *Vi __nek__ sidas __nek__ rigardas.* – You are neither sitting nor looking.

- *Mi __neniam__ diros al iu.* – I shall never tell anyone. (*Mi neniam diros al neniu* is wrong in Esperanto just as "I shan't never tell no-one" is in English.)


# *Mem*

*Mem* means "self" (myself, yourself, himself etc.) and is used to emphasize the noun or pronoun it follows. (Compare *si*, reflexive, lesson 4.)

- *Mi __mem__ faris tion.*  – I myself did that, I did that myself.

# Bye…

There are various ways of saying "goodbye" in Esperanto, but the most usual is 

- *ĝis la revido* – literally  "until the re-seeing" (Compare English "see you", French "au revoir".)

Alternatively it may be said without the article:

- *ĝis revido*.


# The Prefix *ek-*

shows

1. the beginning of an action, or
2. a sudden momentary action.

Examples:

- *__ek__paroli*  – to start speaking
- *__ek__silenti* – to fall silent
- *__ek__sidi*    – to sit down, to take a seat
- *__ek__ridi*    – to burst out laughing
 

# The Suffix *-aĵ*

means "thing", a concrete object:

- *manĝ__aĵ__o*  – food
- *trink__aĵ__o* – drink, beverage
- *bel__aĵ__o*   – something beautiful
- *send__aĵ__o*  – something sent, a missive
